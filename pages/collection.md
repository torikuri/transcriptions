This site contains transcriptions I've created over several years dabbling in music, mostlly as I was learnig to play upright bass switching from guitar becuase among the circle of friends I played with, we had an abundance of guitar players and no bass players, and I've always loved the sound, and later learned I loved the feel as well. Most of the transcriptions are unfinished and mostly used as learning aids to study a particular song or chord progression, or even movement around the fingerboard.
